# Quests

Quests is a web-based social platform for achieving goals. We give our users the chance to collaborate with others by either being a mentor or a mentee through the WOOP (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan) method.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository and move to the app folder

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SpookyGlitches/quests-ph.git
   cd quests-ph/client
   ```

2. Install packages using `yarn install`
3. Rename .env.example to .env and add it with values
4. Create the database and tables using `npx prisma migrate dev`
5. Run the app by typing `yarn run dev`
